# About this APP

The Leo Vegas app consumes an API from TMDB to search and retrieve movies. 

## Assumptions

I did used the API at it's full because I prefered to avoid the authentication. To create watch later and favorites I implemented cookies and not implemented pagination, as it was initially an app to search movies by name.

## Scripts

### `npm start`
to run the server

### `npm test`
to run tests

# About this APP

The Leo Vegas app consumes an API from TMDB but just to search and retrieve some movies. It did not uses the API service to create and manage lists, I used cookies to manage that without the need to create an TMDB account.

## Assumptions

I did used the API at it's full because I prefered to avoid the authentication. To create watch later and favorites I implemented cookies and not implemented pagination, as it was initially just an app to search movies.

## Scripts

### `npm start`
to run the server

### `npm test`
